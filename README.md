INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Install Python (can be installed on the official Python website)

2.Save the project file and then open in coding editor

3. Before running the code go to terminal and install the prompt ‘pip install yt-dlp’ or else it will end up with error



USEAGE INSTRUCTIONS

1. open project file

2. run the code by going into terminal and running the prompt 'python youtubealgo.py'(or if editor has it press the start button)

3. Enter your YouTube search query in the entry field.

4. Choose the order preference (Date or Alphabetical) from the dropdown menu.

5. Click the "Search" button.

6. View the search results in the scrolled text widget.


Project goals: 
Creating an algorithm and search method for users to find and enjoy their favorite videos.  

Significance: 
With a fast and efficient search algorithm, it will allow users to have fun with anything they might want to watch, be it cat videos or funny fails, leading to happiness. 

Course learnings applied: 
With the lessons we learned in class on algorithms and recursion we used an algorithm called quicksort, which stood out to us because, as the name suggests, it is one of the quickest ways to sort various things with the best time complexity of O(n log(n)) and a space complexity of O(log(n)). We used it to sort our list which puts them into alphabetical order and with the list sorted we can change that into a set. Since the list is in a set, we can use that set for a set search, which has an average time complexity of O(1). This allows for a quick and efficient process for our users.  

We have made a UI that would make it easier for the user to access and use the algorithm. This would then pull up 10 search results that match what the user has put in the search bar 

Project issues: 

It was hard to collaborate together online, so we adopted a divide-and-conquer strategy to separate our work responsibilities. This also sped up the process and allowed us to review and perfect the code. 

It was hard for us to translate this code into something that could be shared with others as others do not have the library and files we do, so we spent a good amount of time adjusting and writing the installation and user manual to help users with it. 

The UI was hard to implement with the various buttons we have in our code, however we figured it out eventually

Limitations: 
Since this code is mainly to search for any YouTube videos, it would be impossible to find any videos that are either not on YouTube or hidden on the website.
